# Experiment-6-Series-Queues-with-infinite-capacity--Open-Jackson-Network-
# Aim: 
To find

	a)Average number of materials in the system 
  
	b) Average number of materials in the each conveyor 
  
	c) Waiting time of each material in the system
  
	d) Waiting time of each material in each conveyor
  
If the arrival of materials follow Poisson process with the mean interval time 12 seconds, service time of lathe machine in series follow exponential distribution with service time 1 seconds, 1.5 seconds and 1.3 seconds respectively and average service time of robot is 7 seconds. 
# Software required: Visual Components and Python 
# Theory: 
An open Jackson network is a system of k service stations where station i (i = 1,2,3,…,k) has the following characteristics:
(i)  An infinite queue capacity
(ii) Customers arrive at station i from outside of the system according to a Poisson process with parameter rᵢ.
(iii) Cᵢ servers at station i with an exponential service time distribution with parameter μᵢ.
(iv) Customers completing service at station i next go to station j.
(v) Let λⱼ denote the total arrival rate of customers to station Sⱼ. Then the traffic flow equation is:
